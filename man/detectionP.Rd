\arguments{
\item{raw}{Output of calling \code{\link{read_idats}}, must include component \code{detP} for \code{mask} and \code{detP_threshold}.}

\item{threshold}{p-value threshold (arithmetic scale) above which oberservations are set to NA.}

\item{rgSet}{minfi rgSet object}

\item{male/female}{Indices of male and female subjects}
}
\value{
For \code{detectionP} and \code{detectionP.neg} a modified \code{raw} object with a \code{detP} component, a matrix of detection p-values, added. \code{detectionP} computes p-values on the linear scale, whereas \code{detectionP.neg} returns p-values on the log10 scale.

For \code{detectionP.minfi} a matrix of detection p-values.

For \code{mask}, a modified \code{raw} object, with undetected probes set to \code{NA}.

Vector of length two
}
\description{
Compute detection p-values. p-values are based on the distribution of the intensities of the negative control probes or the U (M) intensities observed for completely methylated (unmethylated) probes, respectively (Heiss and Just, 2019). \code{detP_threshold} generates a plot showing the number of undetected Y chromosome probes among male and female subjects for various p-value thresholds, in order to empirically choose a threshold. Finally, \code{mask} is masking all probes with detection p-values below the specified threshold. \code{detectionP.minfi} provides an implementation for \code{RGChannelSet} objects as used in the \code{minfi} package.
